# PySpark project using DataFrames

## Finding top-rated Christmas movies

### Project Datasets

```txt
data/links.csv
data/movies.csv
data/ratings.csv
```
### ETL pipeline

I have created a python file called `Christmas_movies.py`, within that python file, I have done the below steps:
- Import all required libraries and packages
- Read `.csv` files into DataFrames
- Perform various operations on DataFrames like groupBy, join, where, orderBy
- Write the resulting DataFrame to a `.csv` file

Alternatively, you can run the cells in the `Christmas_movies.ipynb` if you prefer to go through the code step by step.
